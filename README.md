# Project: Marvel Wiki

While just a basic wiki application using the Marvel API, this React based application has taught Jamie a lot about the React framework, maintaining project scope, and simply thinking along the lines that a developer should.

## Functionality

Within this basic website, you can:

### Search Characters

Yeah. That's about it. Look up your favorite character, and look through their available details, including events, stories, comics, series, and *links to available comic prices.

*to be added later
### Final Production

**Note: While the month for Project & Portfolio 4 is over, this project is still under development and will be updated periodically as time is available. Feel free to check back in on future progress!**
